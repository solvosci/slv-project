Easy management for allow users in a task set as follower mode.

Included features, only for those projects in "follower" mode:

- *Allowed users* are new more visible, so can be better edited.
- Also, only users that are also employees could be selected, for this field.
- Assigned user is hidden, so only allowed users works for tasks. Since
  allowed users was only visible for a Project Manager, this addon enables
  access for every user.
